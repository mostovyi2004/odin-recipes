    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin,
        made with broad often ruffled noodlesand
        a tomato or white sauce.</p>

    <p>American lasagna—the southern term is generally used,
        since most Italian Americans trace their origins to
        southern Italy—tends to follow the Neapolitan template,
        but with many variations. A vegetarian version, for example,
        will replace meat with spinach and sometimes other vegetables
        such as peppers and squash. Noodles known in Italy as lasagne
        verdi are made with spinach as an ingredient.</p>
